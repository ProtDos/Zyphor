# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in the Zyphor project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to fostering an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Taking responsibility for our mistakes and learning from them
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission
- Any conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this code of conduct and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples include using the project’s official email, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the maintainers at [elku001@yahoo.com](mailto:elku001@yahoo.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other project maintainers.
