# Zyphor - Example Directory

Welcome to the Zyphor example directory! This section showcases different scenarios that illustrate how Zyphor works. Explore each example to see the system in action and gain a better understanding of its functionality.

## Zyphor - Example 1

Example 1 demonstrates a simulated communication between Alice and Bob. Users can enter messages directed to either Bob or Alice, and the logs display everything happening in real-time. Unlike the chat visualization in Example 2, this simulation accurately represents how the server handles message exchange.

## Zyphor - Example 2

This example is a simple web-based demo that visualizes a chat interaction between two simulated users. While it features a clean UI and engaging animations, it is not a real chat applicationâ€”messages are sent to the server unencrypted. This project serves as a demonstration rather than a production-ready communication tool.
